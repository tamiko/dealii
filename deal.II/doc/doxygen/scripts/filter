# We don't let doxygen put everything into a namespace
# dealii. consequently, doxygen can't link references that contain an
# explicit dealii:: qualification. remove it and replace it by the
# global scope
#
# Now, as of doxygen 1.5, this still produces the wrong result, but
# that's not our fault. This is reported here:
#    http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=365053

# Replace all occurrences of something like step-xx by
#    @ref step_xx "step-xx"
# so that doxygen properly cross references them. Before we had
# this rule, we actually had to write this sequence out in our
# documentation. Unfortunately, as a consequence, there are vestiges
# of this style, so we can't substitute things that look like
# "step-xx". We therefore not substitute if step-xx is preceded or
# followed by quotation marks, or if the text is explicitly
# preceded by a backslash for escaping.
#
# There are other exceptions:
# - the scripts in doc/doxygen/tutorial produce files that have
#   table of contents entries. We don't want these cross-linked
#   to itself.
# - things like step-12.solution.png that typically appear in
#   @image commands.
# - things in headings

# doxygen version 1.7.1 and later have the habit of thinking that
# everything that starts with "file:" is the beginning of a link,
# but we occasionally use this in our tutorials in the form
# "...this functionality is declared in the following header file:",
# where it leads to a non-functional link. We can avoid the problem
# by replacing a "file:" at the end of a line with the text
# "file :", which doxygen doesn't recognize:
s#file:[ \t]*$#file :#g;

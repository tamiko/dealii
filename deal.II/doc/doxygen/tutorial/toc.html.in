<h2>Overview</h2>

<p><b>New to <acronym>deal.II</acronym>?</b> You might want to start with tutorial <a href="../../doxygen/deal.II/step_1.html">Step-1</a> and work your way up to Step-5.
At that point you can explore what features you are interested in and look at the large collection
of programs listed below.
<p>

<p>
The <acronym>deal.II</acronym> tutorial contains a collection of
programs, each more
or less built atop of previous ones, which demonstrate various
aspects of the library. Each such example has the following structure:
<ol>
  <li> <b>Introduction:</b> What the program does, including
       the mathematical model, and
       what programming techniques are new.
  <li> <b>The commented program:</b> An extensively documented listing of the
       source code.
  <li> <b>Results:</b> The output of the program, with comments and
       interpretation.
  <li> <b>The plain program:</b> The source code stripped of
       all comments.
</ol>
</p>

<p>
You can browse the available tutorial programs
<ol>
  <li> as <b><a href="#graph">a graph (see below)</a></b> that shows how tutorial programs build upon each other.
  <li> as <b><a href="toc-list.html">a list</a></b> that provides a short
    synopsis of each program.
  <li> or <b><a href="toc-topics.html">grouped by topic</a></b>.
</ol>
Some of the programs also jointly form
the <a href="../../doxygen/deal.II/group__geodynamics.html">geodynamics
  demonstration suite</a>.
</p>

<p>
The programs are in the <code>examples/</code> directory of your local deal.II
installation. After compiling the library itself, if you go into one of the
tutorial directories, you can compile
the program by typing <strong>make</strong>, and run it
using <strong>make run</strong>. The latter command also compiles the program
if that has not already been done. The Makefiles in the different
directories are based on the small program Makefile template described
<a href="../../development/index.html" target="_top">in this section</a>.
</p>

<h3>Connections between tutorial programs</h3>

The following graph shows the connections between tutorial programs and
how they build on each other.
Click on any of the boxes to go to one of the programs. If you hover
your mouse pointer over a box, a brief description of the program
should appear.

<b>Green octagons:</b> programs that show basic techniques;
<b>Orange boxes:</b> advanced techniques;
<b>Yellow:</b> applications in fluid dynamics;
<b>Light blue:</b> applications in solid mechanics;
<b>Dark blue boxes:</b> time dependent problems.

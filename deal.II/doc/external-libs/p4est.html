    <h1>Using and installing instructions for the p4est library</h1>

    <p>
      <a href="http://www.p4est.org/" target="_top">p4est</a> is a
      library that manages meshes that are distributed across multiple
      processors. It forms the basis of deal.II's implementation of
      finite element solvers that can use meshes that are too large to
      be held on each processor individually.
    </p>

    <p>
      You need to install p4est before deal.II. To do so, you can
      download it from <a href="http://www.p4est.org/" target="_top">here</a>.
      You can either choose to manually compile and install p4est (as
      explained in documentation of p4est), or alternatively use
      <a href="p4est-setup.sh">a script</a> that will automatically compile
      and install a debug and optimized version of p4est.

    </p>

    <p>
      If you want to use the script, copy the tarball to a fresh directory
      together with the <a href="p4est-setup.sh">p4est-setup.sh script</a>
      (the one from this link, not one you may have gotten from the p4est
      webpage). Then call the script as follows:
      <pre>

    ./p4est-setup.sh p4est-x-y-z.tar.gz /path/to/installation
      </pre>
      where <code>p4est-x-y-z.tar.gz</code> is the name of the p4est
      distribution file, and <code>/path/to/installation</code> is a
      directory into which you want to install p4est.
    </p>

    <p>
      In both cases, you can configure <acronym>deal.II</acronym> using a
      line like
      <pre>

    cmake -DP4EST_DIR=/path/to/installation -DDEAL_II_WITH_P4EST=ON -DDEAL_II_WITH_MPI=ON <...>
      </pre>
      if the p4est library isn't picked up automatically. Note the presence
      of <code>/FAST</code>  at the end of the path necessary when using
      the <code>./p4est-setup.sh</code> script to select the release
      version of p4est. Obviously, you
      can also add additional flags to <code>cmake</code> as described in
      the general <a href="../readme.html">ReadMe file</a>.

<h2>New multithreading scheme</h2>

<p>
After the old scheme to implement multithreading in
<acronym>deal.II</acronym> has proven to be too difficult, we
implemented something that is significantly more complex, but at the
same time significantly simpler to use. There is also a report on this
subject, explaining why's and how's, which can be accessed from the
<a href="../../documentation.html" target="body">documentation</a>
page.

<h2>Announcement of <acronym>deal.II</acronym> 3.0.1</h2>

available on the deal.II home-page at

<p>
  Version 3.0.1 is a bug fix release of deal.II 3.0. Overall, the
  number of bugs that have been found is very small (only six) and
  have all been fixed (see 
  <a href="3.0.0-vs-3.0.1.html" target="body">this list</a>). We
  consider this a good sign for pre-release testing.
  By issuing this release, we would now like to close the 3.0.x
  branch. Future work will be on the next major version.

     * Structure for storing degree of freedom information for cells,
     * organized by levels.
     *
     * We store are cached values for the DoF indices on
     * each cell in#cell_dof_indices_cache, since this is a frequently requested operation. The
     * values are set by DoFCellAccessor::update_cell_dof_indices_cache
     * and are used by DoFCellAccessor::get_dof_indices.
     *
     * Note that vertices are separate from, and in fact have nothing to
     * do with cells. The indices of degrees of freedom located on
     * vertices therefore are not stored here, but rather in member
     * variables of the dealii::DoFHandler class.
     *
     * The indices of degrees of freedom located on lower dimensional
     * objects, i.e. on lines for 2D and on quads and lines for 3D are
     * treated similarly than that on cells. However, these geometrical
     * objects, which are called faces as a generalisation, are not
     * organised in a hierarchical structure of levels. Therefore, the
     * degrees of freedom located on these objects are stored in separate
     * classes, namely the <tt>DoFFaces</tt> classes.
     *
     * Access to this object is usually
     * through the DoFAccessor::set_dof_index() and
     * DoFAccessor::dof_index() functions or similar functions of derived
     * classes that in turn access the member variables using the
     * DoFHandler::get_dof_index() and corresponding setter functions.
     * Knowledge of the actual data format is therefore
     * encapsulated to the present hierarchy of classes as well as the
     * dealii::DoFHandler class.

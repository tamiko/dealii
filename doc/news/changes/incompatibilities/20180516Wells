Changed: The OpenCASCADE Manifold classes with names ending in Boundary (i.e.,
NormalProjectionBoundary, DirectionalProjectionBoundary, and
NormalToMeshProjectionBoundary) have been deprecated in favor of renamed classes
ending in Manifold (i.e., NormalProjectionManifold,
DirectionalProjectionManifold, and NormalToMeshProjectionManifold).

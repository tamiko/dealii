Deprecated: The classes SolutionTransfer and parallel::distributed::SolutionTransfer
have been unified to SolutionTransfer. The class now supports both serial and parallel
meshes. The class has lost some functions: the function SolutionTransfer::interpolate()
that takes the input vector as well as the less frequently used functions
SolutionTransfer::prepare_for_pure_refinement() and 
SolutionTransfer::refine_interpolate(). Please use the other functions to accomplish the
same functionality. For the time being, the old implementation has been moved to the
`Legacy` namespace. The old parallel::distributed::SolutionTransfer has been now early deprecated.

New: FE_NedelecSZ is a new H(curl)-conforming element which overcomes the sign conflict problem
which can be encountered for Nedelec elements on hexahedral meshes. This is an implementation of
the method described in the PhD thesis of Sabine Zaglmayr and should be considered over the
FE_Nedelec element where meshes with non-standard orientation are used. Note that not all
functionality (e.g. Hessians), has been implemented for this element.

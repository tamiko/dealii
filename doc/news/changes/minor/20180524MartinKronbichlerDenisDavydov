Improved: MatrixFree::cell_loop() and MatrixFree::loop() directly use
LinearAlgebra::distributed::BlockVector::update_ghost_values() and
LinearAlgebra::distributed::BlockVector::compress() calls on block vectors
with many blocks, rather than splitting each method into two parts for
overlapping communication and computation. The latter is inefficient as soon
as too many MPI requests are in flight.

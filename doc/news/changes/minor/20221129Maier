Improved: The quick_tests mechanism has been redesigned. Quick tests are
now part of the regular deal.II testsuite. This means they can be
configured via the <code>setup_tests_quick_tests</code> target, and run via
invoking ctest from the build directory. The <code>test</code> target will
now ensure that the library is fully compiled and quick tests are
configured prior to running all quick tests.

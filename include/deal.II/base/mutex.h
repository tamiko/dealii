   * A class implementing a <a
   * href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lock_(computer_science)">mutex</a>.
   * Mutexes are used to lock data structures to ensure that only a
   * single thread of execution can access them at the same time.
   *
   * This class is a thin wrapper around `std::mutex`. The only difference
   * is that this class is copyable when `std::mutex` is not.  Indeed, when
   * copied, the receiving object does not copy any state from the object
   * being copied, i.e. an entirely new mutex is created. These semantics
   * are consistent with the common use case if a mutex is used as a member
   * variable to lock the other member variables of a class: in that case,
   * the mutex of the copied-to object should only guard the members of the
   * copied-to object, not the members of both the copied-to and
   * copied-from object. Since at the time when the class is copied, the
   * destination's member variable is not used yet, its corresponding mutex
   * should also remain in its original state.

# Given the name of a configuration (i.e. system-name+compiler-name), this script
# generates a list of files that might contain the stored output of a test. The
# purpose is so that we don't have to store the output of each test for each
# configuration: if the output for a given configuration is equal to that of
# a related configuration, then we fall back to the latter, whereas we use
# the former if it is really different. This way we get a chain of
# possible files.
#
# For example, for a test named "check_me", if we run on a linux x86 system with
# compiler gcc3.4, we may have a file with output stored as
#   check_me/cmp/i686-pc-linux-gnu+gcc3.4
# However, if it is the same as what we would have gotten with gcc3.3, there would
# be no point in storing it and we should fall back to the output of gcc3.3. If
# that output would have been the same as that for a generic compiler (which we
# take as gcc3.2 on a x86 box), then the file
#   check_me/cmp/i686-pc-linux-gnu+gcc3.3
# may not exist either.
#
# When we want to compare generated output against stored output, we should therefore
# first compare against
#   check_me/cmp/i686-pc-linux-gnu+gcc3.4
# and if that doesn't exist against
#   check_me/cmp/i686-pc-linux-gnu+gcc3.3
# and if that doesn't exist again
#   check_me/cmp/generic
# (this latter file should always exist).
#
# This program generates this chain of files to check against, for any given input
# configuration.

Some (if not most) of these tests were ported from the petsc
directory. They fall into three categories:

(*) Ported - Reason: Check a similar real-number functionality with
complex numbers. In this case various modifications are made to
facilitate two-dimensional numbers; eg sd::complex<double> and
PetscScalar.

(*) Cloned - Reason: Check the correct (expected) behaviour is
obtained for petsc-scalar=complex is obtained as was for
petsc-scalar=real. In this case the .cc file is (almost) identical to
the original and the expected output (cmp/generic) is copied from the
original without modification.

(*) New - Reason: Obvious.
